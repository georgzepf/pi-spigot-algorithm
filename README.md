## Spigot algorithm for calculating PI

This is my version of a spigot algorithm for calculating the number PI explained by Prof. Dr. Edmund Weitz / HAW Hamburg. My first approach was to write this in Javascript, but the code would break after around 25 digits because of an integer overflow problem. I'm also fairly new to Python and that's why the code might not be the most efficient.
